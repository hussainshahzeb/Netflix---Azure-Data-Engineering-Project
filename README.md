# Netflix-Azure-Data-Engineering-Project
## Description
# 🚀 Azure End-to-End Data Engineering Project

This project showcases a complete end-to-end data engineering solution built on **Microsoft Azure**, incorporating modern tools and technologies to build scalable, efficient, and production-ready data pipelines.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Azure Data Factory** – ETL orchestration for batch and real-time pipelines  
- **Azure Databricks** – Data processing using Apache Spark and PySpark  
- **PySpark** – Advanced data transformation and analytics  
- **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2** – Scalable data storage (Bronze, Silver, Gold architecture)  
- **Apache Spark** – Distributed big data processing  
- **Databricks Unity Catalog** – Centralized data governance and access control  
- **Delta Lake & Delta Live Tables** – ACID-compliant data lakes and real-time table updates  
- **Databricks Workflows** – Workflow orchestration with parameterization and modular design

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

The architecture follows a layered data lake pattern (Bronze, Silver, Gold) and supports both batch and streaming ingestion pipelines. It integrates multiple Azure services to enable a seamless and automated data engineering workflow.

## 📌 Key Features

- ✅ End-to-end Azure Data Architecture setup  
- ✅ Batch and Real-Time Data Ingestion using Azure Data Factory  
- ✅ Incremental Loading using Databricks Autoloader  
- ✅ Data Transformation using PySpark in Databricks Notebooks  
- ✅ Stream Processing with Structured Streaming  
- ✅ Parameterized Notebooks with `dbutils.widgets`  
- ✅ Data Orchestration with Databricks Workflows  
- ✅ Big Data Analytics using Apache Spark  
- ✅ Delta Live Tables for continuous data pipelines  
- ✅ Interview-oriented best practices and real-world scenarios addressed

## 📂 Project Workflow

1. **Data Understanding & Design**
2. **Azure Free Account Setup & Resource Provisioning**
3. **ETL Pipelines in Azure Data Factory (Batch & Real-Time)**
4. **Data Ingestion, Transformation, and Analysis in Databricks using PySpark**
5. **Incremental Loads with Autoloader**
6. **Streaming with Apache Spark**
7. **Data Governance using Unity Catalog**
8. **Delta Live Tables and Workflow Orchestration**
9. **Final End-to-End Pipeline Deployment**

## 🎯 Objective

To build a real-world, production-grade data engineering pipeline using cloud-native services that demonstrate core skills required for **Azure Data Engineer** roles—including ingestion, transformation, streaming, orchestration, and governance.
